# Bonus Deposits

Bonus deposits often provide players with additional incentives in the form of bonus funds and free spins.

## Bonus Funds on Deposits

### Deposit Bonus

This is the most common type of bonus where the casino doubles or even triples the amount of your deposit. For example, if the casino offers a 100% deposit bonus and you deposit 1000 UAH, you receive an additional 1000 UAH in bonus funds.

### Wager

A wager is a turnover requirement that must be met to be able to withdraw bonus funds. For example, if you have 1000 UAH in bonus funds with a wager of x30, you need to place bets totaling 30,000 UAH (1000 x 30) before you can withdraw the bonus money and any winnings obtained with it.

### Free Spins

Casinos often offer free spins for specific slots. For example, you may receive 50 free spins on a popular game upon registration or after making your first deposit.

### Wager for Free Spins

Winnings from free spins are often subject to a wager. For example, if you won 500 UAH from free spins and the wager is x20, you need to place bets totaling 10,000 UAH (500 x 20) before you can withdraw the winnings.
